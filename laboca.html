        <section class="testolaboca"> <p>La Boca have the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection.</p></section> 
        <section class="testolaboca"> <p>The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London and has gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, and the AOI Illustration Awards.  </p></section> 
        <section class="testolaboca"> <p>Their exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of each of the studio's members' unique influences, having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland.  </p></section> 
        <section class="testolaboca"> <p>“We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall of La Boca. 
            “It's not unusual to have two or three people working on a single piece.”  </p></section> 
        <section class="testolaboca"> <p> Keen to work on more animated projects in the future, the team (based in two studios, one in London and one in Amsterdam) are never short on work from a selection of devoted clients.</p></section> 
        <section class="testolaboca"> <p> In their own words, La Boca’s creations are: “Retina teasing, tactile and occasionally slightly wonky.” </p></section>
